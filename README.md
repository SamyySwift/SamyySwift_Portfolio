# [Project 1: Heart Disease Classifier](https://github.com/SamyySwift/heart_disease_classifier)
## **Project Overview**
For this project, I built a heart disease classifier to predict whether or not a person has a heart diseease or not. This could be helpful for doctors who are new to the field to make better predictions and avoid error while predicting.
I used a LogisticRegression model for this classification problem which was able to predict the target with an accuracy score of 95% after minimal hyperparameter tuning.

# **[Project 2: Real world image classifier](https://github.com/SamyySwift/Real-world-image-classifier)**
## **Project Overview**
In this Project, I trained a Convolutional neural network to recognize features in an image where the subject can be anywhere in the image. I did this by building a horses-or-humans classifier that will tell us if a given image contains a horse or a human, where the network is trained to recognize features that determine which is which.
