# [Project 1: Heart Disease Classifier](https://github.com/SamyySwift/heart_disease_classifier)
For this project, I built a heart disease classifier to predict whether or not a person has a heart diseease or not. This could be helpful for doctors who are new to the field to make better predictions and avoid error while predicting.

I used a LogisticRegression model for this classification problem which was able to predict the target with an accuracy score of 95% after minimal hyperparameter tuning.
