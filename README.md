# **[Project 1: Heart Disease Classifier](https://github.com/SamyySwift/heart_disease_classifier)**
## **Project Overview**
In this project, I built a heart disease classifier to predict whether or not a person has a heart disease or not. This could be helpful for doctors who are new to the field to make better predictions and avoid error while predicting.
I used a LogisticRegression model for this classification problem which was able to predict the target with an accuracy score of 95% after minimal hyperparameter tuning.

# **[Project 2: Real world image classifier](https://github.com/SamyySwift/Real-world-image-classifier)**
## **Project Overview**
In this Project, I trained a Convolutional neural network to recognize features in an image where the subject can be anywhere in the image. I did this by building a horses-or-humans classifier that will tell us if a given image contains a horse or a human, where the network is trained to recognize features that determine which is which.

# Payment_Card_Fraud_Detection

![](/images/fraud_detection.png)

## **Project Overview**
In this project, I useed a credit card fraud detection dataset, and build a binary classification model that can identify transactions as either fraudulent or valid, based on provided, historical data.
The payment fraud data set (Dal Pozzolo et al. 2015) was downloaded from Kaggle. This has features and labels for thousands of credit card transactions, each of which is labeled as fraudulent or valid. In this notebook, we'd like to train a model based on the features of these transactions so that we can predict risky or fraudulent transactions in the future.
